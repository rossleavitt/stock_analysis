**Price_change motivation and usage**

This program references an API created by Ran Aroussi. Find documentation [here](https://aroussi.com/post/python-yahoo-finance).

I developed this code because I wanted a way of accessing historical price data for a particular stock and using the above API was the easiest way to do so. Below is an example of what should be returned after the program is finished running. The green cells are user-input cells and everything else is returned by the program. *Note: in this example I only use four tickers but my program allows for up to 100 tickers to be entered into the first row starting with cell D1. Column C is reserved for Dates. Column B and A reserved for interval, start, end.*
