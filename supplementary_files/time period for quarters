If you are looking to scrape for Quarterly data, use the following key:

Note: make sure you know which quarter you would like to scrape from beforehand.

If you want the most recent quarter then enter "Most Recent Quarter".

If you would like the second most recent quarter then enter "Most Recent Quarter + 1".

If you would like the third most recent quarter then enter "Most Recent Quarter + 2".

If you would like the fourth most recent quarter then enter "Most Recent Quarter + 3".

If you would like the most recent quarter but from last year then enter "This Quarter Last Year". As an example, lets say the most recent quarter was Q2 of 2020 and this option 
was selected then we would be scraping for Q2 of 2019.
